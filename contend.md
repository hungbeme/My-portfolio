 Visual & Interaction Guidelines
Font & Colors:

Use a clean sans-serif font like Inter, Open Sans, or Poppins.

Stick to a neutral background (e.g. light gray or off-white), dark text (#333), and one accent color (blue or teal).

Layout:

Use max-width containers to center content.

Use consistent padding and spacing.

Mobile-first design: stack sections vertically on small screens.

Smooth Scrolling:

Clicking header buttons should smoothly scroll to relevant sections (via JavaScript scroll behavior).

Animations:

Subtle fade-in or slide-up on section scroll can elevate the feel without overdoing it.

Responsive Navigation:

Add a simple nav bar (sticky at top) with anchor links: Home, About, Skills, Projects, Contact.

✔️ Why This Template Works
Professional & Clean: Minimalist layout, clear hierarchy.

Modern & Interactive: Light JavaScript interaction adds polish.

Recruiter-Friendly: Clearly organized, easy to navigate, mobile responsive.

Easy to Customize: You control colors, fonts, text, and project details.

Deploy-Ready: HTML sandbox or static GitHub Pages / Vercel deployment.

📌 What You Can Do Next
Sketch or wireframe this layout in Figma or paper.

Implement sections one by one in your editor, starting with HTML structure, then styles, then small JS enhancements.

Test on mobile and desktop to ensure good responsiveness.

Add your real content (projects, links, CV).
